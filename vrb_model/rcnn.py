    Implements Faster R-CNN.

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape [C, H, W], one for each
    image, and should be in 0-1 range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or evaluation mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors, as well as a targets (list of dictionary),

    The model returns a Dict[Tensor] during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN.

            considered as negative during training of the RPN.

    """
    Constructs a Mask R-CNN model with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone.

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape ``[C, H, W]``, one for each
    image, and should be in ``0-1`` range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or evaluation mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors, as well as a targets (list of dictionary),
    containing:
        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the ground-truth boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format,  with values of ``x``
          between ``0`` and ``W`` and values of ``y`` between ``0`` and ``H``
        - labels (``Int64Tensor[N]``): the class label for each ground-truth box
        - masks (``UInt8Tensor[N, H, W]``): the segmentation binary masks for each instance

    The model returns a ``Dict[Tensor]`` during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN, and the mask loss.

    During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a ``List[Dict[Tensor]]``, one for each input image. The fields of the ``Dict`` are as
    follows:
        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the predicted boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format,  with values of ``x``
          between ``0`` and ``W`` and values of ``y`` between ``0`` and ``H``
        - labels (``Int64Tensor[N]``): the predicted labels for each image
        - scores (``Tensor[N]``): the scores or each prediction
        - masks (``UInt8Tensor[N, 1, H, W]``): the predicted masks for each instance, in ``0-1`` range. In order to
          obtain the final segmentation masks, the soft masks can be thresholded, generally
          with a value of 0.5 (``mask >= 0.5``)

    Mask R-CNN is exportable to ONNX for a fixed batch size with inputs images of fixed size.

    Example::

        >>> model = torchvision.models.detection.maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn(pretrained=True)
        >>> model.eval()
        >>> x = [torch.rand(3, 300, 400), torch.rand(3, 500, 400)]
        >>> predictions = model(x)
        >>>
        >>> # optionally, if you want to export the model to ONNX:
        >>> torch.onnx.export(model, x, "mask_rcnn.onnx", opset_version = 11)

    Arguments:
        pretrained (bool): If True, returns a model pre-trained on COCO train2017
        progress (bool): If True, displays a progress bar of the download to stderr
        pretrained_backbone (bool): If True, returns a model with backbone pre-trained on Imagenet
        num_classes (int): number of output classes of the model (including the background)
        trainable_backbone_layers (int): number of trainable (not frozen) resnet layers starting from final block.
            Valid values are between 0 and 5, with 5 meaning all backbone layers are trainable.
